Over 3,000 women have completed the programme since 2005, with 500+ now holding elected positions in local governance.</p><h2>2. Civic Engagement &amp; Panchayat Access</h2><p>We prepare women to actively engage with panchayat processes — from attending gram sabhas to filing RTI applications. Our legal literacy workshops have helped over 1,200 women access entitlements they previously didn't know existed.</p><h2>3. Mentorship Networks</h2><p>We connect emerging women leaders with experienced advocates who guide them through the challenges of public life. These networks have proven to be one of the most powerful tools for sustained participation and confidence-building.</p><h2>4. Young Women's Councils</h2><p>Recognising that leadership starts early, we run Young Women's Councils in 45 schools across Nalgonda and Warangal districts — giving girls a safe space to practise leadership, debate, and civic advocacy.</p><h2>5.

Our retention coordinators follow up monthly with families to resolve barriers and keep girls in school.</p><h2>4.
